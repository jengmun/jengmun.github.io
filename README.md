# The Game

This game was inspired by the game AuditionSEA which I played frequently as a child and was built as an educational project.

Please visit <a href ="https://jengmun.github.io">this link<a> to play the game.

# Features

## Home Page

1. Before starting the game, select your song using the drop-down list. There are different bpms/speeds to choose from.
2. To opt for full-screen, type "f".
3. Start whenever you're ready!

## Gameplay

1. The aim of the game is to complete pressing down on the arrow keys shown on the screen before time is up, after which you will automatically "miss" the round and go on to the next round.

2. To successfully complete the round, after you are done with the arrow keys, press down on the spacebar when the red target moves to the blue target zone, which also follows the beat of the song played.

3. The number of arrow keys to press follows the level of the round you are in now, i.e. level 1 has 1 arrow key, level 2 has 2 arrow keys and so on. The maximum level for this game is level 9.

4. For levels 1 - 5, there will be 1 round per level. For levels 6 - 9, there will be 4 rounds per level.

5. At the end of level 9, there will be a finish move, which gives the most points out of all the levels. In every finish move, there will be a chance (red) key. For chance keys, press down on the opposite of the arrow key shown.

6. After the finish move, the level will go back down to level 6, and will move towards level 9 and the finish move again.

7. There is also an option to chance, which will increase your score if you complete the round successfully. This can be activated by pressing down on the delete button on your keyboard. Chancing will only be activated from level 6 onwards, excluding the finish move. For each round, there will be 3 chance keys.

8. There are 5 obtainable grades:

- Perfect
- Great
- Cool
- Bad
- Miss

  These will be awarded based on your accuracy when hitting the spacebar, and are listed from highest to lowest points obtained. No points will be awarded for a miss.

9. If a perfect grade is obtained consecutively, there will be a chain. E.g. if two perfects are obtained consecutively, the second grade will be displayed as "perfect x1". Chaining will multiply the score considerably.

10. The time left till the end of the song/game is displayed on the bottom left of the screen, where there is also a progress bar to let you know how far you are into the game.

11. At the end of the song, a scoreboard will be displayed, showing the final score as well as how many times each grade was obtained during the song.

12. If the score obtained is higher than the previous high score (which will be displayed at the top right corner of the screen), the score will be saved and displayed as the new high score the next time the song is played.

13. To retry the game, click on the retry button that pops up below the scoreboard, which will bring you back to the home page.
